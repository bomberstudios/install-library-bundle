# Install Library Bundle

If you've ever built a complex Design System in Sketch, chances are you've had to split your system into a few Libraries. If you then want to share them with your time, you have to send around a bunch of links, and ask people to click them, and everything is a mess.

With this plugin, you'll still need to send a bunch of links, but at least you only have to click once to run it and have all the Libraries installed at once.

The plugin accepts RSS links (for self-hosted Libraries) and Sketch Cloud links (for Libraries shared using Sketch Cloud)

## Sample Libraries

If you want to try the plugin, but don't have any Shared Libraries at hand, try pasting this into the plugin's input to install a few of the Libraries we list at https://sketch.com/libraries/:
